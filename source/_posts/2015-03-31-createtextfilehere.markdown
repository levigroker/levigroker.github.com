[CreateTextFileHere](https://github.com/levigroker/CreateTextFileHere) is a manually activated AppleScript applet used to create a text file at the current Finder location with [BBEdit](http://www.bbedit.com/)  

This utility works in tandem with the 'bbedit' command line binary (which should
already be installed and functional at `/usr/local/bin/bbedit`).

The intention is for this utility to be accessed from the currently active Finder window and acts on the current directory in the Finder. I suggest adding CreateTextFileHere.app to the a Finder window's shelf (command-drag it into a Finder window at the top where the other tool icons are located) so it is available from the Finder as needed. Alternatively, it could be activated from the [Script Menu](https://iworkautomation.com/numbers/script-menu.html).

Thanks to the kind folk over at Bare Bones Software for letting me use a modified version of their text document icon.
