The idea of Mindshare. It's not a new concept and not a new word, but it is important and is the key to fame, power, stagnation, and change.

Mindshare is the idea that your mind spends some percentage of its time thinking about a particular concept. Wikipedia has an [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_share) which conveys the concept but is more geared towards the idea of a consumer/advertiser role. This is incomplete, in my opinion, since this notion has been around far longer than any capitalistic intentions.

When you think about a particular something, you are giving your time to the concept, and in doing so you give the concept power. The more you think about it the more likely you are to share it with others, talk about it, write about it, and think more about it.

There are many aspects of modern life which societies around the world place value on. Most obviously concepts like money and fame come to mind. Power is an insidious one, however. By power I mean power *over other people*. If, by no other coercion than a thought, someone can influence the actions of others, they have power and control over those people. This kind of power is the kind which can start and stop wars.

Throughout history we have examples of ideas controlling large populations of people. Religions, terrorism, government, and morals, all work through this concept of Mindshare. The more people think about a concept, the more popular it becomes and the more power it has. Popular culture references this concept through and through. We have the classic [Orwellian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell) tales like [Animal Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm) and [Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four), of course, but we also see it in movies like Conan, television shows like Stargate, recent popular literature like Harry Potter.

In Conan, we hear about ["The Riddle of Steel"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p2BjhSEnNI) in which James Earl Jones's character gives a speech about how the power of steel is nothing compared to the power of flesh (or the command over the will of people).

Stargate introduced the Mindshare concept in their [Ori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ci6ulWDkOA) plotline by which worship of the Ori gave them tangible power.

Harry Potter has the notion of "he who shall not be named" both out of fear of Voldemort but also to not give him Mindshare.

...and so on.

So, the concept is understood.

Media agencies, political figures, religious outlets, and many other entities wishing to gain power use this concept to gather the Mindshare of as many people as they can.

Mindshare works both for good and for bad. So, you have the power to help an idea grow by sharing it, or help an idea die by resisting sharing it.

[CGP Grey has a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc) discussing this concept, which they call "Thought Germs". Well worth the watch.

If you are offended, outraged, flabbergasted, or otherwise negatively emotionally engaged by someone, say running for political office, these are intentional tactics designed to gain your Mindshare. Do not give the negative any of your Mindshare, and don't propagate it to others. Help the negativity to die, and boost the positive you want to see in the world.
