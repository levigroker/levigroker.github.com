Everyone works in different ways and employ different tools to do the things they want to do. Here's my curated list of tools I find I keep coming back to.

### Development

[Tower](http://www.git-tower.com)  
The best Mac GUI git client I've tried.

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)  
Third party code dependency manager.

[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)  
Awesome documentation browser. Handles many languages and doc sets, but I use it primarily for Cocoa.

[SimPholders 2](http://simpholders.com)  
For finding and inspecting the contents of your app in the simulator.

[iExplorer](http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/)  
For inspecting the contents of your app (or others) on-device, this is a great tool.

[mogenerator](http://rentzsch.github.io/mogenerator/)  
If you're working with CoreData, you should be using this tool to abstract your object classes.

[Fabric](https://fabric.io)  
iOS crash reporting, usage statistics, beta build distribution, and more.

[Cocoa Rest Client](https://code.google.com/p/cocoa-rest-client/)  
A simple GUI alternative to `curl` for testing ReST endpoints.

[Cocoa JSON Editor](http://www.cocoajsoneditor.com)  
Super nice GUI tool for creating and editing JSON files.

[licecap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/)  
Create animated gifs. Really nice for quick app demos on github.

[Accessorizer](http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html)  
Great timesaver for generating boilerplate Objective C code, though Objective-C's language updates have made this tool less useful than it used to be.

### General

[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword)  
A secure vault for passwords, credit cards, passports, etc. Seriously the first thing I install on a new device.

[Dropbox](https://db.tt/ktbXT8tW) (referral link)  
Secure online file storage and sharing. The second thing I install on a new machine, primarily to sync 1Password vaults and other app settings.

[BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)  
*The* text editor. I've been using this since... well since I can remember. It does it all and doesn't get in your way. Installed almost immediately on a new machine.

[Little Snitch](http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html)  
Basically a firewall for outgoing network connections. Probably the fourth thing I install on a new machine.

[Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com)  
A keyboard activated launcher and action performer (hard to describe). It is kind of like spotlight, but with more customizability and functionality.

[Pocket](http://getpocket.com)  
Bookmarking and reading app. Desktop, iOS, and web. A great way to keep hold of the gems one finds while surfing, Twitter, etc.

[Soulver](http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/)  
Awesome calculator for problem solving.

[Yummy FTP](http://www.yummysoftware.com)  
The best FTP/SFTP Mac GUI client I have tried.

[Knox](https://agilebits.com/knox)  
Simplifies creation and management of encrypted disk images. Everything that doesn't go in 1Password goes in here.

[Lingon](https://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/)  
A GUI for creating and managing `launchd` configurations.

[Name Mangler](http://manytricks.com/namemangler/)  
Rename batches of files via a nice GUI.

[Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com)  
Twitter client for Mac and iOS.

[Slack](https://slack.com)  
Team collaboration and communication tool.

[Airmail](http://airmailapp.com)  
The best, but not perfect, email client I have tried since giving up on Mail.app.

[Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00mdf8) (referral link)  
Offsite painless backup solution.

[Bartender 2](http://www.macbartender.com)  
De-clutter your menu bar. This manages all the little menubar warts that seem to show up with various tools. Keeps things nicely tucked away, but accessable.

[BetterTouchTool](http://www.bettertouchtool.net)  
A tool for configuring your interaction with a mouse or trackpad. Basically it allows you to program various gestures, clicks, taps, etc. to do any number of things.

[cd to](https://github.com/jbtule/cdto)  
A great little app which you install in your Finder "shelf" to open a terminal window at the current Finder location. It's a huge timesaver if you are moving between the finder and Terminal a lot.  
There's an updated [Yosemite icon](http://cl.ly/3U01352I293L) (from [https://github.com/jbtule/cdto/issues/9](https://github.com/jbtule/cdto/issues/9)) which you'll most likely want too.

[CreateTextFileHere](https://github.com/levigroker/CreateTextFileHere) (shameless self promotion)  
Another little app which sits in your Finder "shelf" to create a text file at the current Finder location. Created by yours truly.

[Degrees](http://www.degreesapp.com)  
A little weather widget. I use the Mac menubar version. It's nice and unobtrusive.

[The Unarchiver](http://unarchiver.c3.cx/unarchiver)  
Far better tool than Mac OS X's standard unarchiving tool. It handles so many more file formats.
