Having not posted anything here in quite some time I started to wonder "why not?" and discovered, after some introspection, that I have limited myself by considering this *just* a *technical* blog.

Often I would find myself with ideas for technical topics to write about, but faced with the daunting task of writing them up in a digestable format proved, obviously, too big a hurdle to overcome, and nothing actually got posted. So, I'm switching it up a bit.

While I'll still happily write about technical topics which I come across, I also plan to delve into topics which are less technical, and perhaps even more of a personal or sociological nature.

With this change, I've also updated the visual theme here to be a bit lighter and less *default*.

I certainly hope to write more here, and I certainly hope others will appreciate that effort.

Cheers, and *Happy Halloween!*
